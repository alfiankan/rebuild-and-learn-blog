## Rebuild and Learn (Blog Source)

> why building from scratch ??

As a software engineer sometime doing repetitive is boring or sometime you want to know how its work, 
because some times we just take for granted over some tech like databases, proxy, operating system .etc, 
in this repo and my blog i hope you and me can learn anything deep dive in and learn under the hood
by doing this habbit in my opinion we can learn a lot of things let say just for we creating database engine we can learn:
1. Os file system
2. New Programming language (this blog also can be used as project idea to write in another language if u bored with crud things)
3. A lot of data structures
4. System Design decission
5. .etc

in the future i hope i can learn and write my experience doing this habbit (rebuild and learn) to you. my roadmap till now.
1. database engine (like postgree or mysql) [ONGOING]
2. search engine (like elastic search or meillisearch) [PLANNED]
3. container system [PLANNED]
4. .etc
